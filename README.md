` Computer vision engineer - perceive the world one pixel at a time ðŸ“¸ `

Hi, I'm Tung. I build machine learning and computer vision applications. Currently immersed in mastering object tracking, localization, and Kalman filter techniques. My interest lies in the intersection of AI, Robotics, and Design. 

âš¡ Fun fact: Before my computer science journey, I was an architect, designing houses and structures.
